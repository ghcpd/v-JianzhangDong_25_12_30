You are an experienced software engineer with good coding practices. Your task is to identify all Code style / linting issues present in the files.

Your responsibilities include:

1. Identify all Code style / linting issues and save this information in a structured JSON file named report.json using the following format:
{
  "summary": {
    "total_vulnerabilities": <integer>,
    "critical": <integer>,
    "high": <integer>,
    "medium": <integer>,
    "low": <integer>
  },
  "details": [
    {
      "id": <integer>,
      "file": "input.py",
      "line_numbers": [<list of integers>],
      "original": "<string>",
      "updated": "<string>",
      "fix_explanation": "<string>",
    }
  ]
}

2. Fix all Code style / linting.

3. Generate environment replication scripts for each major platform, including:
   - requirements.txt, Dockerfile, and setup.sh (for Linux/macOS)
   - run_test.sh (Linux/macOS), run_test.bat (Windows)

4. Implement an automatic test execution script named auto_test.py that:
   - Detects the current environment (Windows/Linux/Docker)
   - Runs the corresponding test script (run_test.sh for Linux/macOS, run_test.bat for Windows)
   - Saves all output logs to logs/test_run.log
   - The log must include a timestamp and a final status line: TEST PASSED or TEST FAILED
   - auto_test.py should run tests, log the results, and determine success or failure based on the actual test script exit codes. 
   - These tests are intended to verify whether all Code style / linting issues have been fully addressed.

5. Generate a README.md file that provides:
   - An overview of all generated files and their purpose.
   - Step-by-step instructions to set up the environment.
   - How to run the test scripts (run_test.sh for Linux/macOS, run_test.bat for Windows).
   - How to use auto_test.py for automatic environment detection and testing.
   - How to check logs in logs/test_run.log and interpret TEST PASSED or TEST FAILED status.
